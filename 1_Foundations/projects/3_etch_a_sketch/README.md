# Announcements:
While there are definitely improvements that can be made, I believe this suffices as a minimum viable product and provides enough in terms of proof of concept.

# Future Improvements:
1. Being able to add new colors permanently
2. Being able to save
3. Implementing an undo button
4. Implementing a "fill" option
5. Making the page more visually appealing
